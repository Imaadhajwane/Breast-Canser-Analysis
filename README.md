# Breast-Canser-Analysis

## Project Overview:
The project focuses on the detection of breast cancer using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset comprises real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus obtained from breast biopsies. 
The diagnosis column indicates whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B). 
The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify tumors based on these features.

## Data Columns:
1. ID number: Unique identifier for each sample.
2. Diagnosis: Target variable indicating whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).
3. Radius: Mean distance from the center to points on the perimeter.
4. Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
5. Perimeter: Perimeter of the cell nucleus.
6. Area: Area of the cell nucleus.
7. Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths.  
8. Compactness: Perimeter^2 / Area - 1.0.
9. Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the contour.
10. Concave Points: Number of concave portions of the contour.
11. Symmetry: Symmetry of the cell nucleus.
12. Fractal Dimension: "Coastline approximation" - 1.
